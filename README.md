# DH150-Assignment02

## Introduction
For this assignment, I decided to conduct a UT on Amazon. Amazon is an online shopping site in which users are able to purchase from a large collection of electronics, books, music, appliances, apparel, etc. and have items shipped straight to their door. 

Based on my heuristic evaluation, I found that Amazon's three greatest UX flaws were its inconsistent and confusing button-placements,
hidden "help" page, and cluttered product filter system.

### The Purpose of UT
The purpose behind user testing is to improve the design of a product for real users. 
User-tesing tests the usability of a product in order to make sure it is designed so that a real world user 
can accurately and fluently complete tasks or goals, enjoy using the product, and be willing to use it again.
In other words, user testing is needed for successful user-centered design and to make products more useful 
because these test allow for user input on the designs through direct interaction with the product and it focuses 
the designs on the user and their realistic tasks. Usability tests put the product in a real-world scenerio before
the product is released so that it can be improved to have a more satisfactory design, and bugs or frustrations can 
be caught early and fixed. 

### My Usability Test - Amazon
For my usability test, I performed it in my home on my personal laptop as a portable minimalistic lab using the Googe forum below and the live Amazon.com website. I recorded my participant, their screen, and the audio as they completed each task using ActivePresenter so that the session captured the participant's facial expression, thoughts they spoke out loud, and their navigation through the website. This usability test serves as a pilot test in order to test the settings and material.

## Methodology
The test first begins with the participant answering a few background questions concerning if they had used Amazon prior to the test and how frequently they use it. The participant also answers pre-test questions asking for what they predicted the usability of the site would be from just a photo of the homepage and the information page for a product. 
Then, the participant tries to complete three tasks in order to measure how easy it is to use Amazon, targeting the three heuristic flaws I mentioned above. For instance, I am testing Amazon's button-placements by having the user try to add a shampoo and conditioner set, which has a subscription option, to their cart for only a one-time purchase. Since the subscription button is in the same location and the same color as where the usual, one-time pruchase button is, I want to see if the user hesitates or catches themselves before they almost make the mistake of signing up for the subscription instead of only making a one-time purchase. I am testing Amazon's hidden "help" page by seeing if the user can locate the page and use it properly to find return shipping methods. And finally, I am testing Amazon's 
cluttered product filter system by seeing if the user can successfully and efficiently use the filters 
to find a dress with a specified color, overall rating, size, and price.
After the three tasks, participants were asked post-test questions asking participants to rate how easy or difficult each task was, how much time they expected it took them to complete each task, and how likely they would have to complete the task in their real lives. Then they were asked to rate the overall website on how frequent they would use the site, if they found it unnecesarily complex, easy to use, or would need technical support, if components of the site were well integrated or inconsistent, easy to learn or cumbersome, and if they felt confident navigating through the site. The exact questions and directions can be found in the Google form below.

## Improving UT:
Through the pilot test, I learned that participant backgrounds have a significant effect on their perspective of the website. For instance, the participant for the pilot test was a frequent user of Amazon, and while she did become frustrated with some aspects of the website, she was easy to forgive and often dismissed them in her overall review of the website because she was so used to the site. This showed me that her results and efficiency completing the tasks were greatly influenced by her previous experience using the website. I also learned from my participant and the test that there is another way to find the "help" page on Amazon.
The usability test went very well because it ran smoothly and I was able to be a good moderator in which I encouraged the participant, kept her on track, and did not help her or give her any unbalanced praise. One way it did not go so well was that the participant sometimes did not read all the descriptions or steps and was confused. For the next test I should make it more clear that the participant must carefully read all directions. 
One way I could improve my usability test is to make my task scenerios more broad. For instance, in my third task I ask the participant to find for a specific dress for a wedding. Many participants, especially males, will most likely not have the complete this task in their real life. In order to make my usability test more user-focused, I should change the scenerio of my task to be more universal.
