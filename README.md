## The Purpose of UT
The purpose behind user testing is to improve the design of a product for real users. 
User-tesing tests the usability of a product in order to make sure it is designed so that a real world user 
can accurately and fluently complete tasks or goals, enjoy using the product, and be willing to use it again.
In other words, user testing is needed for successful user-centered design and to make products more useful 
because these test allow for user input on the designs through direct interaction with the product and it focuses 
the designs on the user and their realistic tasks. Usability tests put the product in a real-world scenerio before
the product is released so that it can be improved to have a more satisfactory design, and bugs or frustrations can 
be caught early and fixed. 

## My Usability Test - Amazon
For this assignment, I decided to conduct a UT on Amazon. Amazon is an online shopping site in which users are able to purchase from a large collection of electronics, books, music, appliances, apparel, etc. and have items shipped straight to their door. 
Based on my heuristic evaluation, I found that Amazon's three greatest UX flaws were its inconsistent and confusing button-placements,
hidden "help" page, and cluttered product filter system. For my usability test, I performed it in my home on my personal laptop using the Googe forum below. I recorded my participant, their screen, and the audio as they completed each task. 
I am testing Amazon's button-placements by having the user try to add a shampoo and conditioner set, which has a subscription option, to their cart for only a one-time purchase. Since the subscription button is in the same location and the same color as where the usual, one-time pruchase button is, I want to see if the user hesitates or catches themselves before they almost make the mistake of signing up for the subscription instead of only making a one-time purchase. I am testing Amazon's hidden "help" page by seeing if the user 
can locate the page and use it properly to find return shipping methods. And finally, I am testing Amazon's 
cluttered product filter system by seeing if the user can successfully and efficiently use the filters 
to find a dress with a specified color, overall rating, size, and price.
